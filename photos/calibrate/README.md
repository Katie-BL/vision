# Camera Calibration
Place at minimum 10 .jpg photos here for use in camera calibration. It's advised to take many more than 10 photos, but the opencv docs suggest this as a minimum. Ensure you print out the calibration pdf and point it at the camera at different angles and distances. This will give you a solid calibration for use in detection.
